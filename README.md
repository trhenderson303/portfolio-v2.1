## Description
A refreshed take on the second iteration of my professional website, this time including some samples of non-technical work I have done throughout my professional carrer. The application is built using ReactJS and incorporates various libraries, such as Framer Motion and GranimJS, as well as the Material UI framework. As I continue updating this site, I will continue striving towards a product that represents my taste for simple, stylish UI design.
